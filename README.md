# ButtonMash
A WIP program for practicing button patterns, mainly for speedrunners.
This, for now, is mainly a personal project.

## General course of action

This is how I am going to go about making this work for my needs, as well as others if needed (though this isn't really needed right now)

- [ ] Develop the core within this repositiory
  - [ ] Build core mainly for Linux program & Build Linux program on top of core
  - [ ] Modify/Refactor core to work with 3DS & Linux (should establish a fair bit of portability)
  - [ ] Build 3DS program on top of core
- [ ] Separate core and frontend implimentations
